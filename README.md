I'm posting this because i've got surprised as the new way of uploading a file to a repository on github's page has changed
since 2ยบ semester of 2021, this way i got a little of trouble in uploading a project to there recently.

A i saw, in resume using your account's password is not allowed anymore, as now you have to create a PAT token to set the URL
on the git's process, and on the websites i tried to search, some of them aren't actualizated, and even the github's
tutorial is still in the old way.
So i find this helpful for someone who may have some trouble in using git bash to upload a file to the github's repository
